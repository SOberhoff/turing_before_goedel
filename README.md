# Abstract

The main message of the following pages is that mathematical logic—centered around the incompleteness theorems—is first and foremost an investigation of _computation_, not arithmetic. More concretely, we're going to hone in on one key fact: Peano Arithmetic can represent any computable function. It has achieved _Turing completeness_. Armed with this knowledge we will show the following.

* We'll derive the Diagonal Lemma and First Incompleteness Theorem using significantly simplified proofs.
* By adding a wrapper to Gödel's original proof checker we'll be able get $\mathrm{G}$ to not merely assert its own unprovability, but its own _undecidability_, yielding a very easy toy version of the Second Incompleteness Theorem.
* Drawing on analogy between the First Incompleteness Theorem and the Halting Problem produces an equivalent of the Nondeterministic Time Hierarchy Theorem from the field of computational complexity.
* Finally, we'll generalize the First Incompleteness Theorem in the presence of oracles.
