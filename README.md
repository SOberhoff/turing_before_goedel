# Abstract

The overarching theme of the following pages is that mathematical logic---centered around the incompleteness theorems---is first and foremost an investigation of _computation_, not arithmetic. Guided by this intuition we will show the following.

* First, we'll all but eliminate the need for GÃ¶del numbers.
* Next, we'll introduce a novel notational device for representable functions and walk through a condensed demonstration that Peano Arithmetic can represent every computable function. It has achieved Turing completeness.
* Continuing, we'll derive the Diagonal Lemma and First Incompleteness Theorem using significantly simplified proofs.
* Approaching the Second Incompleteness Theorem, we'll be able to use some self-referential trickery to avoid much of the technical morass surrounding it; arriving at three separate versions.
* Extending the analogy between the First Incompleteness Theorem and the Unsolvability of the Halting Problem produces an equivalent of the Nondeterministic Time Hierarchy Theorem from the field of computational complexity.
* Lastly, we'll briefly peer into the realm of the uncomputable by connecting our ideas to oracles.
